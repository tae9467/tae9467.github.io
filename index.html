                <p>
                    Hey, I am Toula Elwell! A passionate Software Engineering student at RIT, 
                    with a flair for creativity and a love for frontend web development. Currently taking an immersion 
                    in the fascinating world of Mathematics and pursuing a minor 
                    in Web Development, I strive to combine logic and aesthetics in my work.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        Throughout my journey, I have embraced exciting challenges, including 
                        participating in hackathons where I had the opportunity to develop some truly 
                        cool projects. One of my highlights was creating an interactive card game using 
                        Python. It was a thrilling experience that showcased my problem-solving skills 
                        and ignited my passion for coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But my fascination with technology does not stop there! Even back in 8th grade, I 
                        indulged in creating my own secret written languages. I quickly discovered that 
                        coding shared the same sense of mystery and excitement, making it an 
                        incredibly fun endeavor.
                    </p>                
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">What am I seeking now?</span> A frontend web development co-op position! I am fueled 
                        by the joy of bringing websites to life. 
                        If you are searching for someone who thrives in turning ideas into visually 
                        stunning and functional websites, then we are a perfect match.

                        am actively working on the implementation of the core functionalities and refining 
                        the user interface using Figma. The website's front-end is being built with React, 
                        ensuring a dynamic and engaging user experience.

                    <p>
                        This project allows me to combine my passion for music and web development. The 
                        ongoing process of working with APIs, designing visually appealing layouts, and using 
                        React to create interactive components has been an enriching learning experience. 
                        I'm excited to see this project come to life and make a positive impact on users 
                        who are equally passionate about music and social connections.
