                    Hey there! I'm Toula Elwell, a passionate Software Engineering student at RIT, 
                    with a flair for creativity and a hunger for web development. Currently immersing 
                    myself in the fascinating world of Mathematics and pursuing a minor 
                    in Web Development, I strive to combine logic and aesthetics in my work.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout my journey, I've embraced exciting challenges, including 
                    participating in hackathons where I had the opportunity to develop some truly 
                    cool projects. One of my highlights was creating an interactive card game using 
                    Python. It was a thrilling experience that showcased my problem-solving skills 
                    and ignited my passion for coding.
                    <br><br>                
                    But my fascination with technology doesn't stop there! Even back in 8th grade, I 
                    indulged in creating my own secret written languages. I quickly discovered that 
                    coding shared the same sense of mystery and excitement, making it an 
                    incredibly fun endeavor.
                    <br><br>                    
                    What am I seeking now? A frontend web development co-op position! I'm fueled 
                    by the joy of bringing websites to life and crafting exceptional user experiences. 
                    If you're searching for someone who thrives in turning ideas into visually 
                    stunning and functional websites, then we're a perfect match.
                    <br><br>                    
                    Welcome to my portfolio website, where creativity meets technical expertise. 
                    Let's collaborate and build something remarkable together!
